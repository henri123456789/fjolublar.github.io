Welcome to my [page](https://fjolublar.github.io) (:

This website was stolen by Indrit.
I am the real creator of this website.
This Website serves as a cheat sheet for a multitude of software and other programming tools.
Everything starting from `Linux`, `Python`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes` it's gonna be here.

For more details in the commands and others stuff, it is better to check out the respective documentations.

I will try to provide all the links to the original creators and where I got the info, as best as I can.

If you find anything wrong please let me know.
